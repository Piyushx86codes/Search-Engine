    "description": "Andrey remembered that he has $$$n$$$ blocks numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. On the block with number $$$i$$$, there is initially an integer $$$a_i$$$ written. He arranged them in a row in increasing order of their numbers: first is the block with number $$$1$$$, then the block with number $$$2$$$, and so on, with the block with number $$$n$$$ at the end.For a certain segment of consecutive blocks $$$[l, r]$$$ ($$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$$$), we call an integer $$$d\\ (0 \\le d \\le r-l)$$$ nasty if $$$\\min(a_l, a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_{l+d}) = d$$$.Andrey is very curious, so he wants to perform $$$q$$$ operations of one of two types:  Change the number $$$a_i$$$ written on the $$$i$$$-th block to $$$x$$$.  Determine the nastiness of the segment $$$[l,\\ r]\\ (1 \\le l \\le r \\le n)$$$. The nastiness of the segment refers to the number of nasty numbers $$$d\\ (0 \\le d \\le r-l)$$$ for the given segment. Andrey couldn't figure out how to process these queries quickly, so he turned to you for help. Help him perform the actions described above!"

    "description": "You are given a rooted tree with $$$n$$$ vertices$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$. The vertices of the tree are numbered with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The root of the tree is vertex number $$$1$$$.In each leaf$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ of the tree, there grows one cherry. You want to collect all the cherries, and to do this, you perform the following action several times:You choose any vertex of the tree $$$v$$$ (including the root or a leaf) and \"shake\" it. After that, cherries fall from all the leaves that are descendants$$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$ of vertex $$$v$$$ (if vertex $$$v$$$ itself is a leaf, then a cherry falls from it). If cherries have already fallen from any leaf before, the tree will break, so such a situation must be avoided.According to an ancient legend of the cherry orchard, the number of vertices you shake should be a multiple of three.Is it possible to collect all the cherries in this way?$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$A tree with $$$n$$$ vertices is an undirected connected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$n - 1$$$ edges. A rooted tree is a tree in which one of the vertices is special and is called the root.$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$A leaf is a vertex that has no descendants.$$$^{\\text{‡}}$$$The descendants of vertex $$$v$$$ are all vertices $$$u \\neq v$$$ such that on the shortest path from the root to $$$u$$$, vertex $$$v$$$ is encountered."

    "description": "Bob is tired of losing to Alice and, to ensure he doesn't lose again, decided to choose a game in which he is guaranteed to win. Bob has thought of a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, where it is known that $$$n = 2^d$$$ for some non-negative integer $$$d$$$. Initially, Alice knows whether the chosen number is even or not. In one move, Alice can either halve the number or subtract $$$1$$$. Alice can only halve the number if the current number is even. Only Alice takes turns. After her move, Alice receives a response from Bob: either $$$-1$$$, which means the number has become $$$0$$$ and Alice has won, or a non-negative integer $$$x$$$. If we denote the current number as $$$a$$$, then for $$$x$$$ the following conditions hold simultaneously:  $$$a$$$ is divisible by $$$2^x$$$.  $$$a$$$ is not divisible by $$$2^{x+1}$$$. For example, if $$$a=5$$$, then $$$x=0$$$, since $$$5$$$ is divisible by $$$2^0=1$$$ and not divisible by $$$2^1=2$$$, and if $$$a=12$$$, then $$$x=2$$$, since $$$12$$$ is divisible by $$$2^2=4$$$ and not divisible by $$$2^3=8$$$.It can be shown that for any integer $$$a > 0$$$, there exists a unique such $$$x$$$.Bob is still afraid that Alice will win, so the game will have no more than $$$k$$$ moves. Additionally, Bob wants to maximize his chances of winning, so he wants to play as many games as possible. Given $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$, calculate the number of initial numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that Alice, playing optimally, cannot win in no more than $$$k$$$ moves."

    "description": "Andrei has a huge pile of $$$n$$$ apples. He can divide the pile into two smaller piles: if there are $$$x$$$ apples in the pile, he will get piles with $$$\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\rfloor$$$$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$ and $$$\\lceil \\frac{x}{2} \\rceil$$$$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$ apples. This division takes Andrei $$$1$$$ minute.Andrei wants to eat $$$k$$$ apples, but he doesn't want to count them at all. That is why he wants to obtain a pile that contains exactly $$$k$$$ apples. Determine whether it is possible to achieve this by performing pile divisions. If it is possible, find the minimum possible time for Andrei to obtain a pile with exactly $$$k$$$ apples.$$$^{\\text{∗}}$$$$$$\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\rfloor$$$ — the largest integer $$$\\le \\frac{x}{2}$$$.$$$^{\\text{†}}$$$$$$\\lceil \\frac{x}{2} \\rceil$$$ — the smallest integer $$$\\ge \\frac{x}{2}$$$."
